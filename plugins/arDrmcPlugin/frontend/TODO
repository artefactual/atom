Build
-----
- I was recommended by thlorenz to stop using grunt-browserify for shims
  and just use browserify-shim and put all the config in packages.json, which
  seems to be the best place. View thlorenz/browserify-shim issue #22.
- Use angular-ui-router instead of ui-router (npm). Having issues with the build.
- Experiment with livereload(), supported by grunt-watch
- Better use of source maps
- Split build in dev and prod (minify css and js)
- yeoman-angular and twbs have the best build ever, learn from it for improvements
- For stylesheet, should we be using recess? csslint?
- Write some tests, configure runner
- Stop using globals like angular, etc... use require() instead!

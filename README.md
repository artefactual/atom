# [Access to Memory](https://www.accesstomemory.org)

Developed and maintained by [Artefactual Systems](https://www.artefactual.com/)

AtoM (short for Access to Memory) is a web-based, open source application for
standards-based archival description and access. The application is
multilingual and multi-repository. First commissioned by the International
Council on Archives ([ICA](https://www.ica.org)) to make it easier for
archival institutions worldwide to put their holdings online using the ICA’s
descriptive standards, the project has since grown into an internationally
used community-driven project. Learn more at:

## Installation

**Production installation**

AtoM is intended to be installed using a Linux-based operating system. We use
Ubuntu LTS releases in development and testing, but users have successfully
installed on other distributions as well.

For other O/S installs, we recommend virtualization.

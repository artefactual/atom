## Security vulnerability

**If you are reporting a security vulnerability**, refer yourself to the
[SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) document. 

## Reporting general bugs

If you have discovered an issue in AtoM, we welcome your reports.

Start by doing a search on [AtoM user forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ica-atom-users)
and in the [AtoM GitHub issues](https://github.com/artefactual/atom/issues)
to see if your question has been considered in the past.

If you are sure that the issue you have is a bug, please open an issue 
on GitHub. If not, feel welcome to open a thread in the AtoM user forum.

The [Troubleshooting guide](https://www.accesstomemory.org/docs/latest/admin-manual/maintenance/troubleshooting/)
contains useful tips on how to find information needed to open an issue,
such as the [version of AtoM](https://www.accesstomemory.org/docs/latest/user-manual/administer/settings/#application-version),
accessing [errors logs and debug mode](https://www.accesstomemory.org/docs/latest/admin-manual/maintenance/troubleshooting/#troubleshooting-logs-debug),
and other information needed to [get support](https://www.accesstomemory.org/docs/latest/admin-manual/maintenance/troubleshooting/#getting-support).

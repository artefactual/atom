To import additional MARC fields not mapped from the EAD document (such as static 
repository information, etc.), you can include those MARC fields here.  These    
additional fields must follow this format:                                       
                                                                                 
1. To insert a field, add the new field anywhere between the <document> tags     
below (AFTER the text "PUT YOUR ADDITIONAL FIELDS HERE").  The new field must begin 
with the letters MARC follow by the MARC field number (e.g. MARC852).                                                           

2. The data must be in one of the following two formats:                                        

a. Subfields embedded within the text.  The subfield indicators are indicated in the
"ind1" and "ind2" attributes as below.  The "fullstop" attribute tells the stylesheet
whether to add a fullstop to the end of the field.  Implicitly encoding of subfield "a"
is optional:

<MARC852 ind1="1" ind2="2" fullstop="no">
University of Washington Libraries$bSpecial Collections$eBox 352900, Seattle, WA, 98195-2900
</MARC852>          

b. In MARCXML syntax.  In this case, the entire contents of the new field are inserted
as is into the stylesheet.  If you want a fullstop, you need to encode it in the data for this
field.  Be sure to follow this format exactly:
     
<MARC910>
<marc:datafield tag="910" ind1="" ind2="">
<marc:subfield code="a">MCM</marc:subfield>
</marc:datafield>
</MARC910>
